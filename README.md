# VEDA Interactive Fire

Custom interactive visualization for VEDA

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-interactive-fire/voici/render/fires.html)

Showing large fires that were burning when the fire atlas was last updated. Only includes fires with an area greater than 2.

You can learn more about how to access [this data](https://firenrt.delta-backend.com/collections/public.eis_fire_snapshot_perimeter_nrt) directly in [this VEDA documentation page](https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/notebooks/tutorials/mapping-fires.html).

⚠️ This visualization is created using a [jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel](https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel) and [voici](https://voici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is rendered client-side (in your browser!) via the magic of [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/). This is an exciting and rapidly evolving space which means that this visualization is highly experimental and likely to break. ⚠️

## Run this locally

First set up your enviornment; in a Python 3.11 environment (I use mamba for env management) run:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build the voici content:

```
voici build --contents content --output-dir dist
```

Serve the content locally:

```
cd dist && python -m http.server 8000
```
